A fun discord bot that I made for my school discord server to bring in some liveliness and interaction.

- Ablility to retrieve live UEFA scores, along with scores from any date in July (~~Now commented out since the season is over~~)
- Ability to check the current temperature in any country
- Ability to check the forecast for the temperature in any country
- Ability to perform basic searches such as "tallest building in the world?"
- Ability to add commands from the discord channels using the `&add` command, and will retain these commands even if the script is re-run
- Ability to clear messages from specific users in a channel
- Ablity to clear given number of messages
- And other general commands such as `&8ball` which acts as a virtual 8-ball
