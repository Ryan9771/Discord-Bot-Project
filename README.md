## General Purpose Discord Bot
A fun discord bot that I made for my school discord server to bring in some liveliness and interaction. 

## Features
- Responding back to specific trigger words
> "No u" `no u`
- Responding to words contained within sentences
> "Seems weird, hmm" `interesting`
- Ability to set a timer
- Ability to create a reminder to ping a specific user when done, along with the message
- Able to retrieve live UEFA scores, along with scores from any date in July (~~Now commented out since the season is over~~)
